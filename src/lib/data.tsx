          <h2 id="`problem`">The Problem</h2>
          An upstream oil and gas company faced persistent financial leakages that significantly
          impacted its cash flow. Despite generating substantial revenue from crude oil exploration
          and production, the company struggled with high tax liabilities and inefficient tax
          processes, leaving little room for reinvestment in critical projects and operations. The
          company’s challenges included unclaimed capital allowances, over-remittance of withholding
          taxes (WHT), underutilisation of available tax incentives, and poor tracking of
          recoverable Value Added Tax (VAT). Frequent tax audits revealed inconsistencies that led
          to substantial penalties and interest on overdue taxes. These inefficiencies created a
          liquidity crunch, necessitating a robust tax strategy to eliminate financial leakages and
          stabilise cash flow.
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          Our tax experts conducted a comprehensive review of the company’s tax processes to
          identify inefficiencies and implement a strategic tax planning framework. We began with an
          in-depth analysis of the company’s tax compliance records over the past five years and
          assessed its effective tax rate. This included a detailed tax health check covering areas
          such as overpayment, unclaimed capital allowances, missed incentives, and audit triggers.
          We recalibrated the compliance framework to ensure accurate reporting of deductible
          expenses, maximisation of capital allowances, and proper tracking of WHT credits. The
          fixed asset register was reviewed and restructured to align with the Petroleum Profits Tax
          (PPT) Act and Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). This involved categorising assets
          appropriately and updating depreciation schedules for accurate tax computations. To build
          the company’s internal capacity, we conducted regular training sessions for the finance
          team, equipping them with the knowledge and tools for proactive tax management.
          <h2>The Result</h2>
          Through these interventions, the company achieved substantial financial savings within the
          first fiscal year. Over $15 million in overpaid taxes was recovered from the Federal
          Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and used to offset subsequent liabilities, significantly
          improving cash flow. The utilisation of tax incentives and allowances reduced the
          company’s effective tax rate by 15%, freeing up additional resources for capital
          reinvestment. Outsourcing tax filing eliminated manual errors and reduced the average time
          spent on tax compliance by 40%, allowing the finance team to focus on strategic
          activities. Our streamlined tax management framework ensured full compliance with
          regulatory requirements, minimising audit risks and penalties. This not only plugged
          financial leakages but also created a sustainable pathway for growth and resilience in a
          volatile industry. &nbsp;

        <h2 id="`problem`">The Problem</h2>A prominent multinational in the manufacturing sector,
        operating subsidiaries across the globe, faced significant challenges with its transfer
        pricing practices. As the group expanded its cross-border operations, tax authorities and
        other jurisdictions scrutinised its intercompany pricing for goods, services, and
        intellectual property transfers. The client faced allegations of non-adherence to the arm’s
        length principle, a cornerstone of global transfer pricing regulations. These allegations
        led to disputes with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), claims of profit shifting,
        underreporting of revenue, and potential tax evasion. This not only jeopardised the client’s
        compliance standing but also exposed it to substantial financial risks, including penalties,
        double taxation, and erosion of investor confidence. Additionally, the client’s existing
        transfer pricing practices were misaligned with its broader financial strategy, hindering
        optimal profitability across subsidiaries. The lack of a consistent pricing framework also
        complicated financial reporting, audit compliance, and intercompany transaction monitoring.
        <h2 id="`solution`">The Solution</h2>
        Our team of transfer pricing specialists developed a strategic approach to resolve the
        issues, ensuring full compliance with regulatory requirements while aligning transfer
        pricing practices with the client’s broader financial goals. We conducted a detailed
        diagnostic, including a functional and risk analysis of intercompany transactions, to
        identify discrepancies between the client’s pricing structures and transfer pricing
        standards. Using economic comparability analysis, we benchmarked transactions against
        industry standards to establish arm’s length pricing for goods, services, and royalties. To
        address these issues, we developed a comprehensive transfer pricing policy tailored to the
        client’s unique operational and financial structure. This policy standardised pricing
        mechanisms across the group, ensuring consistency and transparency in intercompany dealings.
        Robust documentation, including local and master files, was prepared to capture the economic
        rationale behind each transaction, minimising the risk of future disputes. Our team also
        facilitated negotiations with the FIRS to secure Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs),
        providing clarity and certainty over critical intercompany transactions and significantly
        reducing audit risks.
        <h2 id="`result`">The Result</h2>
        The implementation of the new transfer pricing policy and APAs resolved all ongoing disputes
        with tax authorities, enabling the client to achieve full compliance with local regulations.
        The streamlined policy aligned transfer pricing practices with the client’s financial
        strategy, optimising the allocation of profits among subsidiaries and improving group-level
        profitability. The enhanced transparency fostered stronger relationships with regulators and
        boosted the client’s compliance reputation. The resolution of disputes and reduction in
        tax-related risks reassured stakeholders, significantly improving investor confidence. By
        minimising tax risks and aligning transfer pricing practices with financial goals, the
        client achieved greater global competitiveness and positioned itself for long-term growth
        and sustainability. &nbsp;

        Our client is a reputable and highly professional logistic, shipping, clearing and
        forwarding company that provides full logistic support for airfreight, seafreight,
        warehousing, storage and many more logistic services across the whole Niger Delta and all
        other states in Nigeria recently underwent a significant reorganization, reducing its
        workforce from 30 to 16 employees. During this transition, the Chief Accountant abruptly
        left the organization, resulting in a lack of adequate financial oversight. Compounding
        these challenges were technical difficulties encountered during the migration of historical
        financial data into newly implemented SAGE One Accounting software. These issues have led to
        inefficiencies in financial record-keeping, accounts receivable management, and compliance
        with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). To address these challenges, the
        firm required a robust solution, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Accurate migration of financial data to SAGE One Accounting.</li>
          <li>Implementation of internal control procedures for checks and balances.</li>
          <li>Review and enhancement of accounts receivable management processes</li>
          <li>Recruitment of a Chief Accountant to stabilize the finance team.</li>
        </ul>
        The firm turned to Stransact for a comprehensive business advisory and accounting solution.
        <h2 id="`solution`">The Solution: How We Helped</h2>
        Stransact employed a systematic approach to address the firm’s needs, leveraging expertise
        in financial management, data migration, and internal controls.
        <strong>1. Data Migration to SAGE One Accounting</strong>
        We initiated the migration process by extracting historical data from the firm’s previous
        accounting system, Sage 50 (formerly Peachtree). This involved mapping entity accounts
        (e.g., banks, customers, vendors, and tax categories) and processing the source data for
        seamless integration into SAGE One Accounting. To ensure accuracy, we reviewed and
        reconciled imported data, such as trial balances, aged receivables, and payables. Key steps
        included:
        <ol>
          <li>Updating the Chart of Accounts to align with IFRS.</li>
          <li>Analyzing imported records for discrepancies.</li>
          <li>Recommending adjustments and journals to maintain data integrity.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>2. Maintenance of Current Accounting System</strong>
        We reviewed the firm’s accounting policies to ensure consistent classification, measurement,
        and recognition of transactions. Post-migration, we validated financial reports, reconciled
        variances, and implemented necessary updates to the accounting framework.
        <strong>3. Accounts Receivable Management</strong>
        Stransact conducted a thorough review of the firm’s accounts receivable to identify factors
        contributing to low turnover and overdue invoices. Key actions included:
        <ul>
          <li>Reviewing credit policies and evaluating customers’ creditworthiness.</li>
          <li>Circularizing customers to confirm balances.</li>
          <li>Recommending automated invoice reminders and proactive monitoring.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>4. Provision of Loaned Staff</strong>
        To address immediate staffing needs, Stransact provided a qualified loaned staff member to
        act as the interim Chief Financial Officer. This professional ensured continuity in
        financial operations while complying with the firm’s procedures and policies. Key features
        of this arrangement included:
        <ol>
          <li>Supervised financial reporting and operational oversight.</li>
          <li>Regular collaboration with the firm’s leadership to address gaps.</li>
          <li>Prompt replacement of the loaned staff if performance expectations were not met.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>5. Business Processes and Internal Control Check</strong>
        We assessed the firm’s existing operational processes, identified areas of non-compliance,
        and proposed improvements. Our team developed an updated procedural manual and trained the
        firm staff on implementing enhanced processes, including:
        <ol>
          <li>Delegated Levels of Authority (DLA).</li>
          <li>Payment authorization and vouching.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>6. Recruitment of a Chief Accountant</strong>
        Stransact facilitated the recruitment process to secure a permanent Chief Accountant. Our
        services covered:
        <ol>
          <li>Sourcing and screening candidates.</li>
          <li>Conducting reference checks and interviews.</li>
          <li>Managing onboarding to ensure a smooth transition.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="`result`">The Result</h2>
        Through a collaborative approach, Stransact delivered a comprehensive solution, achieving
        measurable improvements:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Enhanced Financial Accuracy: Successful migration of historical data and implementation
            of IFRS-compliant processes improved financial reporting accuracy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Streamlined Processes: Updated internal controls and automated reminders reduced
            accounts receivable aging and improved operational efficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Staff Stability: The provision of a loaned CFO and the recruitment of a Chief Accountant
            stabilized the firm’s finance team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cost Savings: By identifying inefficiencies and optimizing processes, achieved
            significant cost savings.
          </li>
        </ol>
        This holistic approach to strengthening compliance and financial accuracy positioned the
        firm for sustainable growth and operational excellence. &nbsp;

      <article>
        <h2 id="`problem`">The Problem</h2>A medium-sized manufacturing company needed to transition
        from its outdated payroll software to the use of custom software for its payroll processing.
        The company had around 80 employees at the time of transition. As the business expanded, the
        HR team faced increasing challenges in processing payroll efficiently. With a combination of
        manual calculations and outdated payroll software, they struggled with frequent errors,
        delayed payroll cycles, and frustration from employees about payment discrepancies.
        <h2 id="`solution`">The Solution</h2>
        The team commenced a review of the existing software of how payroll is operated and
        collection of required information needed for the update of the custom payroll software. The
        key features of the new system included:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Smooth Transition: The transition and transfer of information from the manual
            calculations to the customized payroll system was seamless and easy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Automated Data Integration: The system integrated directly with the company’s
            time-tracking, ensuring that period worked, and other variables were correctly accounted
            for.
          </li>
          <li>
            Real-Time Tax Calculation: The custom payroll software was designed to update tax rates,
            benefits, and deductions based on the latest local, state, and federal regulations. This
            minimized the risk of compliance errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Self-Service Portal: Employees were given access to a secure self-service portal where
            they could view their pay slips. This reduced the volume of HR inquiries regarding
            payroll.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customizable Reporting: The system allowed the HR team to generate customized payroll
            reports for auditing purposes, which saved time when preparing for year-end tasks.
          </li>
        </ul>
        &nbsp;
        <h2 id="``">The Result</h2>
        After implementing the custom payroll system, the custom payroll software saw improvement
        across these key areas:
        <ul>
          <li>Payroll errors dropped as a result of using the custom system.</li>
          <li>
            The time spent on processing payroll was reduced. What used to take several days now
            took only a few hours, allowing the HR team to focus on other strategic tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            With automated tax calculations, deductions, and benefit updates, the HR team no longer
            had to manually check for errors, which also saved valuable time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Timely and accurate payments led to a noticeable increase in employee satisfaction, with
            fewer complaints about payroll issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            The payroll system’s automatic updates ensured that the client was always in compliance
            with the latest tax and labor laws, significantly reducing the risk of costly fines and
            penalties.
          </li>
          <li>
            As the company continued to grow, the custom payroll solution was easily scalable to
            handle additional employees without the need for major system changes. The software
            could accommodate different employee classifications, benefits structures, and multiple
            tax jurisdictions.
